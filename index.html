Amidst these rumours, it becomes necessary to know how to check the quality of rice so as to avoid consumption of the fake plastic rice. Plastic rice Biryani served to a customer! Hyderabad Hotel staff beat TV journalist who complained

        The reports of the fake plastic rice have alarmed many who were confident about shopping for groceries from the small scale groceries. However, there are various simple steps to identify if the rice is real of plastic and it is comparatively easy to check the quality of rice in India. The plastic rice is made of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds and can lead to cancers, birth defects, immune system suppression and developmental problems in children. However, here these simple tips will help you to identify plastic rice and be safe!
        
        Plastic rice is made of the synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are being used on a large scale for production of various products. Plastic is extremely dangerous for human health, and plastic rice has a shine to them that is not seen in normal rice. Injecting plastic may even be toxic and causes endocrine disruption that leads to the development of cancers and other serious health issues. While the use of plastic in our day to day life itself is being criticised, consuming plastic rice can prove to be very dangerous. Here is how you can identify plastic rice.

        <h2>1. The glass of water technique</h2>
        <img class="plastic-rice-img" src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/how-to-identify-plastic-rice.jpg" alt="">
        While it is difficult to differentiate between real and fake or plastic rice by simply looking at them, there are other techniques that can help in checking the rice quality. The easiest way to identify plastic rice from real rice is by adding a handful of rice to a bowl of water and stir well. Plastic rice tends to float on top while the real rice would have drowned in water.

        <h2>2. Burn them down</h2>
        <img class="plastic-rice-img" src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/how-to-identify-plastic-rice-4.jpg" alt="">
        Plastic is known to give out a peculiar smell while burning and this simple trick can help you identify if the rice is real or fake. Take a few grains of rice and burn it with a match stick, if the rice is actually made of plastic you will see the product curling in and giving out a peculiar smell whereas the real rice may turn black but will not give out the smell of plastic.
      
        <h2>3. The boiled rice technique</h2>
        <img class="plastic-rice-img" src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/how-to-identify-plastic-rice-2.jpg" alt="">
        This technique of checking the quality of rice is fool proof but takes a lot of time. Simply boil the rice and leave it outside in a box for 2-3 days. If the boiled rice is made of plastic, it will remain as it is and will not have any fungus. However, real rice will develop fungus on it if it is kept outside for such long time at room temperature.

    <h2>4. Hot oil technique</h2>

This is similar to the glass of water technique, but it requires boiling oil. Drop a few grains of rice into a bowl of hot oil, and in this case, the plastic rice will submerge and go to the bottom of the bowl while the real rice will float above. In addition to this, the plastic rice will also form a layer on top of oil from the plastic that has melted.

These simple steps can help you to check and analyse the quality of the food product that you consume. Consuming plastic rice is extremely unhealthy, and it is important to take every step possible to avoid the consumption of this fake rice. Plastic takes years to decompose even on earth’s surface so imagine what will happen to your body if you have plastic inside! It is best to stay safe and eat healthily rather than face the consequences.
